Welcome to the Python and Visual Studio Code installer.

To use this script, ensure you run it as an administrator.
This script will install Python and Visual Studio Code sequentially.

Instructions:
 If you do not have Python installed, this script will automatically install it for you.
 If you already have Python installed, the script will skip the Python installation step.
 Similarly, if you do not have Visual Studio Code installed, the script will install it.
 If you already have Visual Studio Code installed, the script will skip its installation.
 If you prefer to install only Python or only Visual Studio Code, separate scripts are available for each:
   - To install Python only, run "install_python_windows.bat" or "install_python_windows.exe"
   - To install Visual Studio Code only, run "install_vscode_windows.bat" or "install_vscode_windows.exe"

Enjoy your setup process!

I will play some music once you select an install package.
