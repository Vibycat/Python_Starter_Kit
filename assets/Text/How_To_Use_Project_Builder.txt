Learning to use the Project Builder

Start by running the Executable file. 

When the Executable file is run, the terminal will open and prompt the user for a project name. 
please not that the project name will follow the same rules as creating a new folder on your computer. 
    this means no special characters

after selecting a new name for your project, the script will ask if you want to generate example files or just the project structure:

Generating the Template files will create example files in the main directories within the project structure. 
    this is useful when figuring out how to sort and store your files 

Generating the structure only.
    this will create the Main Project folder and the Subdirectories without any files. 
        this is useful when starting a project from scratch 

When the project is created the user will be prompted to open the new project in visual studio code. 
    this option will open the root project directory and all Subdirectories within the project. 
        this is useful if you do not want to search your file explorer for your new project.
